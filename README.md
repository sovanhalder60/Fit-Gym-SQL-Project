# Fit-Gym-SQL-Project

Welcome to my first SQL project, where I analyze real-time gym data from Fit Gym! This project uses a dataset of some visit records to explore and analyze gym membership and visit data, 
answering key business questions that can help a fitness center understand its customer base better and optimize its services.

Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate essential SQL skills by analyzing a dataset from Fit Gym. Using SQL,
I explored membership details, member demographics, and visit patterns to derive actionable insights. 
This project showcases fundamental SQL techniques, including creating tables, writing queries, and analyzing data.
